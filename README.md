### Solutions to first 100 Project Euler problems.

_Note: This repo is incomplete_

Problems can be found [here](https://projecteuler.net)

I understand that Project Euler does not like people sharing their solutions, so I will only share the first hundred solutions.

The maintainers of the project themselves have [stated](https://projecteuler.chat/viewtopic.php?t=6431) that:

>"Generally we accept that the first one hundred or so problems have for some time now openly discussed in blogs, videos, and so on. Closing the stable door on that long gone horse is a fools errand."

Hence, I assume they are okay with me sharing the first hundred solutions.
